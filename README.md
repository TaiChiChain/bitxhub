`Axiomesh` is a blockchain infrastructure with high scalability, privacy, security and composability. `AxiomLedger` is the consensus layer of Axiomesh ecosystem.

## Start

`AxiomLedger` start script relies on [golang](https://golang.org/) and [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki). Please
install the software before starting.

Use commands below to clone the project:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:axiomesh/axiom-ledger.git
```

`AxiomLedger` also relies on some additional tools, use commands below to install:

```shell
make prepare
```

Finally, run the following commands to start a minimal nodes testnet.

```shell
make cluster
```

**Noting:** `make cluster` will use `tmux` to split the screen. Thus, during commands processing, better not switch the terminal.
